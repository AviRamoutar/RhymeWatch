- **Catch the vibe** – See whether today’s headlines tilt 📗 **Bullish** or 📕 **Bearish** before you open your trading app.
- **Multiple news feeds** – We fall back gracefully from NewsAPI → Finnhub → Google News RSS, so you rarely see an empty dashboard.
- **One-click tickers** – Handy buttons for AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, TSLA… plus your own “🟊 My Tickers”.
- **Sleek dark mode** – Minimal, Apple-esque styling that looks great on a second monitor.

*Frontend eye-candy will get even better in 1.1 — stay tuned.*
